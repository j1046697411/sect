I'll implement Kotlin benchmarks for the lko-ecs-benchmarks project by following these steps:

## Step 1: Update build.gradle.kts
- Add kotlinx-benchmark plugin and dependencies
- Add all-open plugin for JMH annotations
- Configure benchmark targets and iterations
- Set up proper dependencies on lko-ecs core project

## Step 2: Create Project Structure
- Create src/commonMain/kotlin/cn/jzl/ecs/benchmarks directory
- Create benchmark classes for different ECS operations

## Step 3: Implement Benchmark Classes
- Entity instantiation benchmarks
- Component access benchmarks
- Query operation benchmarks (including our new streaming operations)
- System execution benchmarks
- Memory usage benchmarks

## Step 4: Configure Benchmark Settings
- Set up warmup and iteration counts
- Configure different benchmark configurations (fast, main, etc.)
- Exclude any non-benchmark code

## Step 5: Run and Verify Benchmarks
- Run benchmarks to ensure they execute correctly
- Verify results are meaningful and comparable

The benchmark classes will cover key ECS operations to provide performance insights, with a focus on the new QueryStream extensions we've implemented. I'll follow the same pattern as the reference project but adapt it to the lko-ecs architecture.
